# Modified UNO Game Project
1. Description of our problem domain: <br>
      Our problem domain is a card game. Our project aims to develop a card game like Uno through Java. The objective of Uno is to be the first player to get rid of all their cards by matching them in color to the top card of the discard pile. The game will allow only four players. Uno cards come in four colors (red, blue, green, and yellow) and have numbers and special action cards like "Skip," "Plus 4," etc.

2. A brief, high-level description of what kind of application our team is thinking of developing: <br>
      We aim to develop a Java-based card game application that offers both a Human-Computer game mode and a Human-Human game mode. Additionally, we will integrate an card deck API to enhance our game. We will develop UI for our interface adapters.
